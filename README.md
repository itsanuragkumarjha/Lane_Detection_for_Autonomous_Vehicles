# How big Tech like TESLA are incorporating this:
- Tesla's autonomous vehicles use a computer vision system called Tesla Vision to detect lane lines and other environmental variables. Tesla's Model 3 has cameras mounted on the front, rear, left, and right sides of the car to monitor the surrounding area. These cameras can detect road markings, obstacles, pedestrians, and other vehicles. Tesla's Vision system also uses Hydranets to only use what's needed by the system, and runs at least 50 neural networks simultaneously.
