# Lane_Detection_for_Autonomous_Vehicles
This repository contains a lane detection pipeline using OpenCV and a Tkinter-based GUI for video comparison. The tool processes input videos to detect and highlight lane lines, and displays both the original and processed videos side by side. Features include curvature calculation, speed control, and dark mode.A project leveraging futuristic ideas
