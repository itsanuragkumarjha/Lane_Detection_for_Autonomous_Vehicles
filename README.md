## üöÄ How big Tech like TESLA are incorporating this:
- Tesla's autonomous vehicles use a computer vision system called Tesla Vision to detect lane lines and other environmental variables. Tesla's Model 3 has cameras mounted on the front, rear, left, and right sides of the car to monitor the surrounding area. These cameras can detect road markings, obstacles, pedestrians, and other vehicles. Tesla's Vision system also uses Hydranets to only use what's needed by the system, and runs at least 50 neural networks simultaneously.

## üìΩÔ∏è Demo for lane detection on sample videos:
![Demo](detection.gif)

## üìΩÔ∏è Demo for GUI showing comparison real-time: 
![Demo](GUI.gif)

## üöÄ Installation:
### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lane_Detection_for_Autonomous_Vehicles.git
cd Lane_Detection_for_Autonomous_Vehicles
```
### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
### Process a Video:
- Modify the input and output paths in the script to point to your video files.
- Run the lane detection script to generate the processed video.
### Launch the GUI
- Use the provided script to start the Tkinter GUI.
- The GUI will display the original and processed videos side-by-side for comparison.
- Use the control buttons to toggle information display, dark mode, and adjust the video playback speed.

## üìÇ Project Structure
- lane_detection_scripts.ipynb: Contains the lane detection pipeline.
- gui_lane_detection.ipynb: Contains the Tkinter GUI implementation.
- requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies required for the project.
